# Advent of Code Solutions (2021-2023)

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges from 2021 to 2023. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles throughout December leading up to Christmas.

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year's folder containing daily challenges:

Each year's folder contains subfolders named by the day of the challenge (e.g., `01`, `02`, etc.), and these subfolders include the solution files and input data for that day.

## Languages

I am tackling these challenges primarily in Python, but I also aim to include solutions in C and Haskell for a diverse learning experience.
