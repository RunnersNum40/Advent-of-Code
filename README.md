> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solvedin any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

I am working on completing each puzzle for fun and practice. My intention is to have each done in Python, C, and Haskell for variety. I'm working on these during random free time so I expect to take a long time to finish.
